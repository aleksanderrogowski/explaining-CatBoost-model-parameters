# explaining-CatBoost-model-parameters
Code used during data analysis for Explaining the Parameters of an Artificial Intelligence Model Using CatBoost for Posture Recognition.

Example data files recorded during the experiments (acceleration, gyroscope and magnetoscope sensors readings) and infant position as manually annotated by trained individuals are available in the example_data_files directory

Directory 'scripts' contains Python files used to preprocess those files, compute time- and frequency-domain features, create a file with vectors of features for all recordings and train models with all and with individual groups of features.
